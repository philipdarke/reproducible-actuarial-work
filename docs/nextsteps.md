title: Reproducible data science techniques in actuarial work
---

Actuaries are well placed to introduce data science techniques to actuarial work, but face learning new tools, potentially in conjunction with larger datasets and more complex analytical pipelines.  These challenges are also being faced in science and by other professions.

We hope we have convinced you that working reproducibly helps address the challenges of working in data intensive fields.

We make the case that actuaries should adopt these techniques to streamline how actuarial work is produced - freeing them to focus on adding value for their organisations and clients.

## Next steps

If you wish to introduce a reproducible process in your organisation:

1. Take an existing process or report that is repeated often
1. Develop a [minimal viable solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) using the tools and techniques introduced in the exercises
1. Pilot it with colleagues and let others contribute to the project
1. Share what you learn within your organisation
1. Consider what you can share more widely e.g. with the actuarial community

Good luck!
